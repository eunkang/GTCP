# GTCP

Georgia Tech Crime Prevention is an application to prevent crimes by providing a track system and sending alerts before any criminal action takes place. This app is ideally used by the students and the police department of Georgia Institute of Technology. Currently, Georgia Tech continuously provides the updated crime logs and sends crime notification emails to the students for further protection. However, there are still crimes happening not only outside the campus but also inside the campus; therefore, GTCP will let students notify their locations to the police department and send any emergency alerts when they are in any risky situations. The police department will then be able to track the students and receive information of the students who sent the emergency alert through their app. This will help reduce crime rates in Georgia Tech and prevent any mishaps from happening.
